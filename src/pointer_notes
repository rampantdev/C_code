most compilers will initialize ints to 0 if they are declared outside a function. Pointers declared outside of functions should be initialized to NULL.

    char my_string[40] = "Ted"; 
When the double quotes are used, instead of the single quotes as was done in the previous 
examples, the nul character ( 
'\0
' ) is automatically appended to the end of the string.
